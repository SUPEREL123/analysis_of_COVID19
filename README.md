# Africa has the lowest number of deaths. I think that's not because the better control in virus than other continent but they did not report the death to the government due to government problem or issue
# South America has the most death in COVID-19
# Europe and North America has similar pattern shown in the graph
# When other continents keep increasing the number of deaths, Oceania keeps very stable. I think that's because Oceania is the only continent that is in the South half of the Earth.
